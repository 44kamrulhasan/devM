<!DOCTYPE html>

In HTML, "DOCTYPE" stands for "Document Type Declaration" and is a special 
instruction at the beginning of an HTML document that tells the web browser 
which version of HTML the page is written in, ensuring it renders the content 
correctly; essentially, it informs the browser how to interpret the document 
and which rendering mode to use, like "standards mode" instead of "quirks 
mode" if present.
